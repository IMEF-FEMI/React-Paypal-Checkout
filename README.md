## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/IMEF-FEMI/React-Paypal-Checkout.git
npm i && npm start
```

#### To run this project you need a Paypal Developer account. 
You can sign up [here](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications/).  Afterwards you will need to plug your keys into a *.env* file that needs to be created as well. 

```shell
// backend/.env
```

That is it for the setup!
